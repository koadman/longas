- Intro
  - Evolution: the joint processes of reproduction with mutation and natural selection acting on mutations
  - Molecular evolution has left an indelible mark on microbes
  - Metagenomics, has for the first time offered a glimpse of the genetic structure of uncultured microbial communities
  - Metagenomics, in its current form, destroys some of the most valuable information present in a sample: genetic linkage.
  - Cells are shredded to get the DNA -- mixes DNA among many cells
  - Chromosomes are sheared down in to fragments palatable for sequencing instruments. Usually less than 1Kbp (though sometimes 10-20kbp). 
  - Single cell genomics can resolve this to some extent
  - Computational methods very helpful
  - Evolution provides a primary signal for read classification
    - Evolution of nucleotides/amino acids
    - Evolution of gene content

  - Previous work
    - whole-metagenome binning
      - composition classifiers
      - identity/homology classifiers
    - community composition without binning
      - AMPHORA, MLTreeMap, others?
      - MetaPHlan

  - In this work we employ phylogenetic models of nucleotide and amino acid substitution to perform metagenomic binning and community composition analysis
  - We evaluate the new method and compare it to previous approaches using simulated datasets

- Design and Implementation
  - Core workflow similar to AMPHORA, MLTreeMap
  - Marker gene set expanded to include 38 Bact+Arch markers, mtDNA, euk, 16s, 18s, viral fams
  - Details of each step
    - Process sequence (reads or assembly) to identify similarity to marker genes
      - LAST, bowtie2
    - Generate high quality alignments
      - reverse translation to DNA when possible
    - Place reads on a phylogenetic reference tree
    - Compute summaries of read placements
      - taxonomic summary
      - other summaries
    - Or compare among samples
      - stuff A, B, and C

== Figure 1: Client Workflow ==

  - Database update workflow
    - pull any new genomes from NCBI/EBI/JGI/otherI
    - run core workflow to identify marker homologs (--besthit --isolate)
    - assigned unique ID, linking to taxon ID etc.
    - build tree (FastTree)
    - etc, etc
  - Taxonomy reconciliation

== Figure 2: DB Update Workflow ==

- Results
  - Simulated datasets
    - How they were generated
    - Building PhyloSift DBs without test datasets
  - Precision, recall, and F1
  - Relationship between F1 and neighbor taxon density
  - Compute time

== Figure 3: Test set generation showing tree, phylo scope exclusion ==

== Figure 4: Accuracy on simulated data ==

== Figure 5: RMSD community reconstruction or PCA result ==

  - Application to a real dataset (which one? human gut?)
    - correspondence with 16s on this dataset?
    - any other interesting features?

== Figure 6: Krona on a human gut sample ==

- Discussion
  - Fundamental limits to computational methods -- resolving linkage among polymorphisms in a population
  - Advantages to the approach taken by PhyloSift
  - Disadvantages
    - many
  - Future work
